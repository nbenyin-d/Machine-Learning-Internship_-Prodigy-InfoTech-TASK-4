- Due to the large size of the dataset, rying to upload it would prove to be a challenge. However it can be accessed with the link below;

- The basic principle of how I was able to develop tis model is in the .ipynb file, TASK 4.
- After loading and preparing 20,000 images, they were split into training and testing data.
- RandomForestClassifier was used; trained with the traing data and used to classify the images in the testing data.
- In the end accuracy of 98.775% was acheived.
